Version 1.1

* class.R Replaced all slots=c() arguments in setClass calls with representation=representation() to make package compatible with R-oldrelease (R-2.15.3). Users should expect that this will be changed back to slots are some time in the future.

* Removed seewave import, and instead added seewave R code for functions stft,
dBweight, ftwindow, hamming.w, hanning.w, blacktop.w, flattop.w, and
rectangle.w to the package. The only effect for users is that seewave and its
dependencies are not required for installation of monitoR.

* Updated list of authors to include seewave and tuneR authors.
