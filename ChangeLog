monitoR

2014 MAY 15 Sasha Hafner (sdh11@cornell.edu) and Jon Katz
Version 1.0.2

* monitoR-package.Rd Added disclaimer, funding acknowledgement, and made 
small corrections.

* monitoR_QuickStart.Rnw Added disclaimer and funding acknowledgement.

* Methods-plot.R and showPeaks.R Changed how ask argument is used for plot 
methods for templateScores and TemplateList objects, and also for showPeaks
function, to make sure ask par is set back to the initial value. Also now
the ask par is not changed to the value of the ask argument until after the 
first plot has been produced.

Version 1.0.1

* Classes.R Replaced all slots=c() arguments in setClass calls with 
representation=representation() to make package compatible with R-oldrelease 
(R-2.15.3). Users should expect that this will be changed back to slots 
sometime in the future.

* Removed seewave import, and instead added seewave R code for functions stft,
dBweight, ftwindow, hamming.w, hanning.w, blacktop.w, flattop.w, and
rectangle.w to the package. The only effect for users is that seewave and its
dependencies are not required for installation of monitoR.

* Updated list of authors to include seewave and tuneR authors.
